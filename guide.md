Week 4: Connecting React.js to APIs

Learning Goals:
Learn to make HTTP requests in React.js using fetch or axios.
Manage API data with React state and hooks (useState, useEffect).
Handle loading states and errors in the UI.

Handle loading and error states in the UI.
Connect the React app to the Week 3 Task Manager API.


Project: Build a Task Manager Web App.
Features: Display, add, and delete tasks by connecting to the Task Manager API; include loading and error states.



Week 5: Basic DevOps - Version Control and CI/CD

Learning Goals:
Master Git workflows (branching, merging, pull requests).
Understand CI/CD concepts and set up a pipeline with GitHub Actions.
Learn Docker basics (images, containers).


Resources:
Git Branching Guide: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell
GitHub Actions Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
Docker Get Started: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/


Tasks:
Create a Git repository for the Task Manager API and practice branching/merging.
Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to lint and test the Node.js API.
Containerize a simple Node.js app with Docker.


Project: Set up a CI/CD Pipeline for the Task Manager API.
Features: Automatically lint and test the API on push to GitHub; create a Dockerfile for the API.



Week 6: React.js Advanced Features

Learning Goals:
Learn React Router for client-side navigation.
Understand state management with useContext or Redux Toolkit (basic).
Explore local storage with localStorage.


Resources:
React Router: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial
Redux Toolkit: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started
MDN Web Storage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage


Tasks:
Create a multi-page React app with React Router.
Implement a simple state management solution using useContext.
Save and retrieve data using localStorage.


Project: Enhance the Task Manager Web App.
Features: Add navigation (e.g., separate pages for active and completed tasks); persist tasks in localStorage.



Week 7: React Native Basics

Learning Goals:
Understand React Native fundamentals (components, props, state, JSX).
Set up a React Native environment with Expo CLI.

Notes for Implementation

Time Management: Allocate 3-4 hours daily for learning, practice, and project work.
Mentoring: Schedule weekly check-ins to review progress, address challenges, and provide feedback.
Environment Setup: Ensure Node.js, Expo CLI, Docker, and Git are installed before starting.
Testing: Keep testing simple (e.g., basic Jest tests for API, UI tests for React.js).
Deployment: Use free tiers of Render or Heroku to avoid costs.
Support: Encourage the intern to ask questions and seek clarification on complex topics.
